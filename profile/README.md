### About Us

**InReach** is a trans-led 501(c)(3) tech nonprofit organization increasing resource access for the diverse LGBTQ+ community. InReach’s long-term vision is for every LGBTQ+ person to have on-demand access to the safe, affirming resources they need to thrive.

About the InReach App: InReach has built the world’s first tech platform matching LGBTQ+ people facing persecution or discrimination with safe, verified resources (‘InReach App’). The InReach App is available on web (desktop and mobile), and native iOS and Android. Over 9,000 services across North America are currently listed, with new verified services added every day by trained volunteers. InReach’s open-source technology instantly matches LGBTQ+ people in need with independently verified safe housing, medical and mental health care, immigration and other legal help, meal assistance, education and employment, translation, community and spiritual support, and more critical services. InReach is a comprehensive, digital one-stop-shop for all intersectional community needs, with listed verified services for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, refugees and other immigrants, BIPOC communities, transgender folks, youth and caregivers, and more. The InReach App is free for everyone – including lawyers, case managers, social workers, and other service providers and community organizations searching for affirming resource referrals for LGBTQ+ clients. So far, over 400,000 people have used InReach to access safe, verified resources.
