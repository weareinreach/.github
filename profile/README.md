### About Us

**InReach** is a trans-led 501(c)(3) tech nonprofit increasing resource access for the diverse LGBTQ+ community. InReach’s long-term vision is for every LGBTQ+ person to have on-demand access to the safe, affirming resources they need to thrive.

**About InReach (fka AsylumConnect)**: InReach has built the world’s first open source verified LGBTQ+ resource platform. The InReach platform is available on web (desktop and mobile), and native iOS and Android. Thousands of services across North America are currently listed, with new verified services added every day by trained volunteers. InReach connects LGBTQ+ people in need with independently verified safe housing, medical and mental health care, immigration and other legal help, meal assistance, education and employment, translation, community and spiritual support, and more critical services. InReach is a comprehensive, digital one-stop-shop designed for intersectional community needs, with listed verified services focused on LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, refugees and other immigrants, BIPOC communities, transgender folks, youth and caregivers, and more. InReach is free for everyone – including lawyers, case managers, social workers, and other service providers and community organizations searching for affirming resource referrals for LGBTQ+ clients. So far, over 420,000 people have used InReach to access safe, verified resources.
